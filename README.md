# Pyhton-JSON-Project
A Pyhton project which is effective to see an example of how to implement and use JSON in Pyhton. 

Program uses https://api.nobelprize.org/2.1/nobelPrizes?_ga=2.96356767.2000896419.1706655639-527502705.1706655639 as url and converts it data into an JSON. Then it puts all the data into a dictionary.

With this link, program can access all detailed information of Nobel Prizes which is given between the years 1901 to 1905. Program first prints out the basic information of the prizes by categorizing it. After that, user can search for a specific year and category of the prizes. If user just wants to access the information about a year, program prints out all categories of that year.

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
